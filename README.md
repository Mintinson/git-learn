1. Prefix: A prefix is a group of letters that is added to the beginning of a word to modify its meaning or its part of speech. For example, in the word "unhappy", "un-" is a prefix that means "not".
2. In linguistics, the term "copula" refers to a grammatical construction that links a subject and a predicate together. It is typically a verb form or a word that expresses the relationship between the two.One example of a copula in English is the verb "to be" (e.g., "John is a teacher"). In this example, "is" is the copula that links the subject "John" and the predicate "a teacher." The copula construction allows us to express relationships between the subject and predicate, such as equality ("John is a teacher"), inequality ("John is not a teacher"), or identity ("John is himself").
3. Infix: An infix is a group of letters that is inserted into a word between its root and its suffix to modify its meaning or its part of speech. English does not have many common infixes, but some languages like Finnish use infixes frequently.

4. Morpheme: A morpheme is the smallest meaningful unit in a language that cannot be divided into smaller meaningful units. It can be a single word, a prefix, suffix, root, or a combination of letters with a meaning. For example, the word "unhappy" contains the morpheme "un-", which is a prefix that means "not".
